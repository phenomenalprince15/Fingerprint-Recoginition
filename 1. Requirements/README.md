# Requirements

## Introduction
* Widely used technique in fingerprint detection.
* Because of lifetime invariance, uniqueness and convenience of fingerprint. It is a widely used technique.

## Research
* Going through various research papers, mostly there is an image enhancement step and other steps could vary depending on the algorithm.
* In this, we utilized MINUTIAE matching algorithm to execute the results.

## Cost and Features
### *Cost*
Since the algorithm can be executed on MATLAB software, it's free of cost.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H
## WHO
This is helpful in securing or privacy much better. It can be used in phones, tracking crime and in other technological devices.

## WHAT
A fingerprint algorithm that gives you all minutiae points.

## WHEN
When people need to have privacy, we can implement the algorithm in those technical devices. 

## WHERE
It can be put to use in various sectors like in schools, colleges for attendance tracking, tracking crime rates.

## HOW
The system used is matlab, just go the implemenation folder and select img_007_project.m and select any image available in the database to execute file.
